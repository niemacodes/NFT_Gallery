# NFT Gallery 

Created an NFT gallery to display and explore any wallet's NFT's using Alchemy's NFT API: 

Learned things like:
- How to fetch NFTs that belong to a wallet address
- How to fetch NFTs based on the collection it belongs to
- How to use RESTful API calls via Alchemy NFT API to fetch and display NFTs
- How to style my website with Next JS and Tailwind CSS

Upcoming updates:
- Copy contract address functionality 
- Viewing more than 100 NFT's at once 
 
Example displaying full NFT collection:
